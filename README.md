# Lottery-Dapp
This repository is clone-coded for [Infran lecture](https://www.inflearn.com/course/ethereum-dapp/dashboard).
However, I modified the existing code as below:
- Modified the code to match the latest solidity and react versions
- Create tables quickly using react-table
- Previously, challenges could only be selected from a, b, c, and d, but modified to allow all cases
